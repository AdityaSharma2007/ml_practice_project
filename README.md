# ml_practice_project
A beginner Machine Learning classification project using Logistic Regression to predict placement status based on CGPA and IQ. Includes preprocessing, feature scaling, model evaluation, and decision boundary visualization.

🚀 Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is part of my Machine Learning learning journey where I implemented a basic classification model using Logistic Regression.

The goal of this project is to understand the complete ML workflow — from preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.
